This repository conatins the script used to automatise the upload and naming of bike rides from a garmin gps device (which didn't support wifi connections) to the social network Strava. Initially, files had to manually be uploaded to the platform. Using windows event manager and task scheduler a script is triggered everytime an usb device is plugged in my personal laptop. If the device is recognised as my personal head unit the last rides would be uploaded to Strava and named according to their route.
